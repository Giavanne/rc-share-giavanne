          <p>In 249 BC, the Roman general Publius Claudius Pulcher had his "sacred chickens" " thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of Drepana, saying "If they won't eat, perhaps they will drink." He promptly lost the battle against the Carthaginians and 93 Roman ships were sunk. Back in Rome, he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.</p>

    <h1>Learning goes both ways at codman square health center</h1>
      <h2>by Griffin Connolly<br>Speacial To The Reporter</h2>
      <p>The Easy Essay is the 2+2=4 of writing. Just as 2+2=4 works at all levels of mathematics, the patented and free Easy Essay Process works at all levels of expository/proof writing and appears to eventually help the logical thought process itself. The Easy Essay is being used by children who can write a simple sentence and is being taught as a college class. This process is useful in TBI, ADHD, Sp Ed and dyslexia through and beyond the SAT and GED exams. It can be learned in 5 minutes by following simple prompts and can be later used or taught without a computer. The program is effective in any language (see translator) and is limited only by the capacity of the user. Post graduate students are using it to organize their master's thesis' and a doctor is using it as a template for organizing the chapters in a book on new medical procedures, as the program can expand from the basic five paragraph essay to a 17 paragraph essay (e.g. the skeletal aspects of a chapter). Doctors ask their patients to use it and can then give better service, in less time and the patient doesn’t forget anything. The patient simply enters the thesis, “I need to see the doctor.” and then follows the prompted process. Businesses use it for quick, organized memos, reports (e.g. “Mr. Smith needs to rewire his kitchen.”), and more. Businesses often ask for a one page summary. US Presidents have done this. If the concept is acceptable, then more can be asked for. If not, the reader has not wasted their time. The program is perfect for both sides of this equation. Thusly, The Easy Essay is helpful for virtually anyone who desires to better organize their written or verbal communications.</p>
